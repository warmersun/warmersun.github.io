#I'm sorry
3 part apology
## Acknowledgement
It should never have come to this. We are very late in the game of fixing things even though my generation knew about the issue all along. We did absolutely fucking nothing. OK, barely anything.

##We were/are wrong
Whatever I am doing, you are doing, most anyone is doing is just plain stupid and wrong. We need to realize this. It leads us falling off the cliff. Whatever me and you think was so important and beneficial that we spend our time doing it ... chances are it's not, it's just downright wrong because it leads to mass suffering and we know it.

## I'll make it up to you
