The game v2

Picking card, rolling dice game elements are cross cutting the design thinking process.
Try building this in a *mural*  - how to roll dice?

# Objective 
The goal of the game is to invent something to solve a real problem using exponential, emerging technologies.
Players work in teams ???
Who wins? Biggest *impact* 

### TBD 
How to measure or represent impact?

# Setup - What’s needed
* Cards , earch one representing an emerging technology 
* Dice, doesn’t matter what type
* Token, one that can be placed on the card to represent doubling of current state. Alternatively, the back side of the card can show doubling.
* Short videos for problem presentation 
* Method cards - for empathy, for ideation 

# Gameplay 
### TBD 
* -What if the players go through the phases but the topic changes each time? So each phase is standalone...-
-* No, that won’t work because the d fin phase does not use the emerging technology chosen-
-* What if they only pick cards after?-
-* No-

## Pick an emerging technology by picking a card 

### TBD
* Are the cards face up?
* Can two layers choose the same one?
* If not,  roll a dice to define order
* If not, how can a player still work with her favourite technology?
* Does a player pick only one or multiple?

## Run an experiment
Players are told to think of the present state of the technology.
Then they roll a dice, representing an experiment trying to improve the state of the art.
They can keep rolling until the dice always comes out higher than before. This represents advancement. If it doesn’t, that represents a failed direction.
### TBD 
* What happens if they don’t take risk, how do they bank it?
* Need some concept of money or funding that defines how many experiments they can run.
* How to do /convergence/?
* 
## Convergence 
Pull a convergence card. If the doubling was reached then the other converging tech is also doubled.
### Issue
It’s too much here. Do it when kids complain they picked an emerging technology that they no longer want.

## Doubling 
For successful experiment it means: doubling. Players are encouraged discuss what that means for the emerging technology they are looking at.
Place token on card to keep track of doubling.

## Present a problem - AKA grand challenge
Don’t make it too generic, like “ climate change, it’s all bad, we are all going to die” or “water crisis, nothing to drink”. For empathy to kick in this has to be very specific, a story zooming in on a specific incident from someone’s first hand experience. Best presented as a short video. 

## Empathy phase
The goal of this phase is to discover something together - through empathy, through looking at the human experience - that wasn’t obvious at first.

If time permits empathy methods can be introduced here.

### TBD
How can players choose a problem to work on? Maybe 2-3 related short stories?

## Define phase 
Taking what was learned in the empathy phase, players define what they are aiming to solve by asking the famous *How might we...?* question.

## Team formation
Teams work together and are used to provide constructive feedback to other teams at the down selection phase and in the “testing” phase.
### TBD

## Brainstorming phase 
### Ideation 
Go broad

### Down-selection
Cluster and pick
Opposing team to ask hard questions about feasibility. Plays devils advocate. 
Each team should select something that they are uniquely suited for building because of their emerging technologies.

Brainstorm techniques can be introduced here. Pick a method card.

### TBD
First team to reach a target number of ideas wins. This goes back to “money” in the game. Maybe they win another experiment. Maybe they can finish the doubling.

## Prototyping
Teams build their invention. Use what you have from arts and crafts materials to LEGO, LittleBits, mini drones etc.
Play pretend. 

### Meanwhile ..
The facilitator should look up examples of similar real world inventions.

## Testing phase - storytelling 
Teams show their creations with *storytelling* . The opposing team provides feedback.

### TBD
Who wins?
