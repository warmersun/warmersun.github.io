The game 

# Objective

The goal of the game is to invent something to solve a real problem using exponential, emerging technologies.
Players level up their abilities in different technologies in various ways which allows them to invent things that require more and more advanced capabilities.

Players work in teams or alone. teams are formed during gameplay.

Who wins? Biggest *impact*, determined by voting at the end of the game. Eqch player has the same number of votes.

## Game between games

Players carry are rewarded for their advancements: they carry on their impact from game to game and are incentivised to follow the subjects.

# Setup - What’s needed

* Cards , earch one representing an emerging technology . The cards list the capabilities enabled at different levels.
    * level 1 is today
    * level 2 is double
    * level 3 is quadruple
    * Level 5 >10x
    * Level 8 > 100x
* Dice, doesn’t matter what type
* News card. Contains a recent news story and the icon of the related emerging technology
* Token, one that can be placed on the card to represent doubling of current state. Alternatively, the back side of the card can show doubling.
* Short videos for problem presentation
* Method cards - for empathy, for ideation

## Facilitator

The fcilitator, usually the adult, is responsible for preparing and setting up the game. H or she also leads players through the game phases and makes sure the different activities are timeboxed. The facilitator can also join in the game as a player.

# Gameplay

## Present a problem - AKA grand challenge

The facilitator presents a challange.

Don’t make it too generic, like “ climate change, it’s all bad, we are all going to die” or “water crisis, nothing to drink”. For empathy to kick in this has to be very specific, a story zooming in on a specific incident from someone’s first hand experience. It’s best presented as a short video.

## Empathy phase

The goal of this phase is to discover something together - through empathy, through looking at the human experience - **that wasn’t obvious at first.**

If time permits empathy methods can be introduced here.

## Define phase

Taking what was learned in the empathy phase, players define what they are aiming to solve by asking the famous **How might we...?** question.

## Brainstorming phase

### Ideation

The facilitator set a target number of ideas to be collected.
Go bro
Brainstorm techniques can be introduced here. Pick a method card.

First person to reach a target number of ideas wins and gets an impact badge.

## clustering

Group related, similar ideas together

## Timing is everything

Players are reminded by the facilitator that more than anything else, what determines if a company will succeed in implementing an idea is timing.
Does it intercept the the exponential growth curve at the right time?
Is it too early or too late?

Players will bet on their ability to level up the technology needed for their implementation.
Everyone starts from present day’s level of capabilities.

Level up in different technologies
* Can two players choose the same one? *Yes*
* Does a player pick only one or multiple? *Multiple*

There are different ways to level up

### Run an experiment
Players are told to think of the present state of the technology.
Then they roll a dice, representing an experiment trying to improve the state of the art.
They can keep rolling until the dice always comes out higher than before. This represents advancement. If it doesn’t, that represents a failed direction.

Players have *3 experiments*

### Impact badges
Players can have impact badges from previous gameplay that grants them further experiments

### News
* Pull a card representing a recent news story. The technology mentioned on the card levels up.
* Show any news piece collected. The technology mentioned on it levels up.

### Convergence
Pull a convergence card. The other ,converging technology then reaches the same level as the driver technology. I.e. if the player levelled up the driver then gets the same level in the converging technology for free.

## Team formation

Teams work together and are used to provide constructive feedback to other teams at the down selection phase and in the “testing” phase.

## Down-selection
pick
Opposing team to ask hard questions about feasibility. Plays devils advocate.
Each team should select something that they are uniquely suited for building because of their emerging technologies.

**The level that they reached in the different technologies gives them different capabilities accordingly. This sets what is feasible and what is not!**

## Prototyping
Teams build their invention. Use what you have from arts and crafts materials to LEGO, LittleBits, mini drones etc.
Play pretend.

### Meanwhile ..
The facilitator should look up examples of similar real world inventions.

## Testing phase - storytelling
Teams show their creations with *storytelling* . The opposing team provides feedback.

## Announcing the winner
Each player has an impact badge she can award to someone. This again carries on to subsequent games.
the layer with the most impact badges awarded - i.e. with the most votes - wins.
