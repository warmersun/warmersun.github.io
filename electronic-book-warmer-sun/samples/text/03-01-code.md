## Code

[See the docs]({{ site.canonical-url }}/docs/editing/markdown.html#code) on writing code in markdown.

Trust the geeks, they've got this sorted. Here's a code block from [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/221/).

~~~ js
int random()
{
     return 5; // Chosen by dice roll, guaranteed to be random
}
~~~

What about two consecutive clode blocks? Here's some YAML book metadata from this project, followed by some [funny code from StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/766363/1781075).

~~~ yaml
project:
  # The name of the organisation or entity that owns this project
  organisation: "Electric Book Works"
  # A live web address for the organisation
  url: "https://electricbookworks.com/"
  # The name of the project of books in this folder.
  name: "The Electric Book workflow"
~~~

~~~ php
// Replaces with spaces the braces in cases where braces in places cause stasis 
   $str = str_replace(array("\{","\}")," ",$str);
