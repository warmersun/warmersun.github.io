## Video

The Electric Book template includes an include tag for easily inserting videos from YouTube and Vimeo. [See the docs for more]({{ site.canonical-url }}/docs/editing/video.html).

In this example, we have a YouTube video.

{% include youtube id="OJWJE0x7T4Q" %}

And a Vimeo one.

{% include vimeo id="113933422" link="https://www.vimeo.com/113933422" description="The Hey Duggee series trailer" %}
