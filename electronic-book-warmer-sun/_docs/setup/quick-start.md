# Quick new-book setup

This quick setup assumes you already have [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Prince](http://www.princexml.com/) (if you want PDFs) installed and working on your computer. ([Detailed installation guidance here](setting-up-your-computer).)

1. Download the [Jekyll template](https://github.com/electricbookworks/electric-book).
2. Open `_data/meta.yml` and replace the sample book information there with your project and book information.
3. In the `book` folder edit the template files, and add your book's content.
4. To modify the design, edit the `.scss` files for each output format in `book/styles`.
5. Run the `run-` script for your operating system. (On OSX and Linux, you need to [give it permission](http://stackoverflow.com/a/5126052/1781075).)
6. The first time you run it, start with the 'Install or update dependencies' option.

There is much more detail in [the docs](../).
