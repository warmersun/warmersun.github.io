Run the template's `run-` script for your operating system and follow the prompts. For these to work, you must already have Jekyll installed and working.

* On Windows, run `run-windows.bat` by double-clicking it from your file explorer.
* On Linux, run `run-linux.sh`. You may have to run it from a terminal, and first enter `chmod +x run-linux.sh` to give it permissions, then `./run-linux.sh`.
* On Mac OSX, double-click `run-mac.command` in Finder. You may need to give the file permission to run first. To do this, in a Terminal in the same folder as the script, type `chmod +x run-mac.command`.

Word output is a conversion to MS Word from one of the other output formats. Our script generates your book in a format you choose (e.g. the print PDF version) and then converts the content into MS Word files.

Word output requires that you have [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) installed.
