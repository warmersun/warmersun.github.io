# Asking the right questions

Our public education system puts children on a 12 year course, hoping to prepare them for the time they finish.
If I count the college yers on top of that then we’re looking at 15, 16, 17 years.
Do we claim to know what the world will be like in 15 years ? Have they even thought about that?
K, maybe they have... t some degree., but where are the iterations, the course corrections, the pivots, the reflections built in? Pretty much nowhere.
It reminds me of politicians claiming to know all solutions and making empty promises.

Einstein said that if he had an hour to solve a challenge he would spend the first 55 minutes asking the right questions; framing the problem. Because he is sure that by having the right questions he can come up with the solution in the remaining five minutes.

Peter Diamandis also emphasizes questions. His point is that we are going to live in a place - and to a great degree we already do - where we can get the answer to any question we ask. ( just literally ask Google, Alexa, Siri, Cortana, Bixby or one day “Her”). So what will matter  than is who can ask the better questions.

Warmer Sun doesn’t claim to know all answers about hat and how we should teach or children. But e can start by asking questions. Collecting them, discussing them and revisiting them from time to time.

For starters, here are a few , for he top of my head:
* What is the right amount of introduction to a subject that is needed *before* we ignite curiosity?
* Is learning languages still relevant, is it a good use of kids time - knowing that we can predict very decent translation devices and interpreters  few years don the line?
We already have Google earbuds, Skype already translates video chat conversations on the fly. They already do a decent job and it’s safe to say that they will only get better. 15 years ago there was no Google. Thy went from nothing to almost Babelfish in 15 years. Another 15... where will it be? As always, remember that the next 5 years will not bring the same amount of progress as the last 15 did. That would be linear growth. It will bring way way more...
If we decide to spend that time on something else how could we still enjoy the cognitive benefits of language learning? What could we substitute it with?
* How should we teach math? Coding. AI. All the new subjects...
