# Why this community is created 
Sparking notes 

1. SU , why it was founded 
2. Singularity Preschool - why, k12 is 12 years 
3. SU criticism, opening up - YouTube, online courses - 10x
Still expensive 
5. Ned to adapt the curriculum for younger audiences 
* Tried Exponential Youth program
* Exponential Families - this is the Tesla Roadster 
* More accessible: make education, STEM toys - missing the cognitive framework 
* Fill the gap, digitize, demonetize, democratize, 
* finally decentralize

Danielle role model, much needed
Early adopters
