It all started when I read Ray Kurzweil’s book a the Singularity Is Near.
Ray mâles predictions about the future which if true mean profound changes to technology, society and everyday life in general.
Then I started paying attention and learning about the technological singularity from various thought leaders. So far I don’t see any sign that their reasoning is wrong.
So what are these predictions and who is this guy anyways? Is he someone worth listening to?

Kurzweil bio

I was 18 years old when I got my first PC for my big birthday. As I was learning MS-DOS commands  from Peter Norton - before switching to Norton Commander (remember those?) one thought occurred to me.. How did Bill Gates write MS- DOS? He must have needed a PC. But how did he use a PC to write the first operating system if there was no operating system on the PC yet? Chicken and egg.
And how did Intel design the first microprocessor without a PC (which needs a microprocessor)? Pen and paper? It must have been hard.

The point I’m trying to make here is that once we have rudimentary tools things become easier. Thins about writing the next version of MS-DOS using a PC that already runs DOS.
Think about how much easier it must have been for Intel engineers working on the Pentium chip design years later when they could do their design work on PCs and run CAD software to calculates where and how to put those gazillion of transistors and logic gates.

This is Kurzweil’s argument: we make better tools to make better tools.
The law of accelerating returns.
It’s like compounding interest on a credit card.

Kurzweil made two observations which, together have huge implications. First, that this doubling patter that we see in Moore’s law is not new. It has been going on for a long time. In fact he shows that this exponential progress in computation can be traced back to day one, the beginning of life (!!!).
And it also will not stop. Once we can’t make chips with faster or more transistors because of hitting some hardcore physical limitations- like speed of light, atomic scale, whatever ... we will figure out a new paradigm and keep going. That what we’ve been doing and that what we will keep doing.
Second that it’s not only computers. We see the same exponential growth in any technology that becomes information driven.
This is very profound.
To give some recent examples, think of what happened to music after tapes and records have been digitized. When a song became just. Stream of bits.
What happened to photography when it went digital?
What happened to news papers when /paper/ got replaces by digitized words and sentences?

Today’s exponential technologies are similar digitizations of different industries:
3D printing is information enabled manufacturing
Synthetic biology men as that we can read and write DNA, th basic building blocks of life. Once we sequenced a DNA it’s only information. We can manipulate it digitally, assemble it back into a living organism and see what happens. Scary? Sometimes.

Our senses? When we describe our sensory input, visual input - what we see, auditory input - what we hear, tactile input - what we touch and feel digitally... it opens up whole new worlds. Literally. virtual worlds.

The rest is the easy part (well, if one is as smart as Kurzweil). Looking at the rate of change. Predicting where we will be in 1,2,5,10 years , what capabilities will become unlocked and then find g applications for those capabilities.

Let’s pause here for a second.
What is the scientific process ?
It starts with observation. Then we try to explain what we see (observe). We make a /model/.
A mod l is only useful if we can make predictions with it.

I can observe that yesterday was a nice sunny day and today is raining and explain it saying that baby Jesus is crying in Heaven. But that explanation won’t help me predicting how the weather will be tomorrow. Will he be happy? Or still sad?
Explaining things in retrospect is always easier and of little use.

We use the model to predict what is going to happen and then try it out. We do an experiment. If our predictions were right and came to being then the model was useful. If not, then we need to try harder and come up with a better  explanation.

The model will serve us until we find some new observation that doesn’t fit. Then we “rinse and repeat “. The new model has to still work for all the old cases but it now also has to work wher the previous one broke down.

This ability to make predictions is where Kurzweil gets as scientifically sound as it gets. Here is his current track record.

TBD

When I look at the predictions he has in talon for the future I can’t help but think about those who will be most affected: today’s kids.
