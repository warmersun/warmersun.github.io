Convergence

My generation witnessed the tipping point of two emerging technologies: computing and networks.
It’s interesting to look back at how deceptive this was.
Even the two greatest pioneers of personal computing played down the potential of the internet. Both Steve Jobs and Bill Gates woke up late to the realization of how much the internet, the Web is just everywhere.

Mosaic browser was launched in 1993. Gates’ paper started the browser wars , MS was clearly playing catch-up.

Apple  was initially struggling to get its internet services right (with iTools, .Mac and MobileMe).

IMHO neither Microsoft nor Apple is an "internet company".

Of course computing and networks has changed the world ... from the start of the PC era in 1975 to the .Com crash in 2000 it took 25 years.
Things have sped up since. It won't take 25 years to see a similar level of change, as the next thirty years are projected to bring as much change as the last one hundred did.

If you have doubts consider how long it takes now to make a billion dollar company - a so called "unicorn".
US STeel, the first billion dollar valuation comapny took 28 years to get there - through various mergers.
Today with a 7 year average some copanies do it within a year.

It's easy to see how computers and networking converges.
With faster internet, broadband, people have more reason to buy computers. Faster computers allow for better web servers. More users on the network starts a flywheel effect where joining the network becomes more attractive everytime someone joins.

Today there are not two but a dozen technologies converging.

Here is a challenge. Right down the different emerging technologies on cards, randomly select two and see if you can come up with an example for how these are interrelated, how the progress in one field helps the other.
