Let’s try and understand exponential growth a bit better.

You might have heard the story of the inventor of chess. Folklore says the king , the maharajah invited him to his palace because he joyed the game very much and wanted to reward its inventor. So he asked him what kind of present he wishes.
The inventor said: put one grain of roc on the fist square of the board. Two on the second, four on the third and so on. I only ask for the rice that you put on the last square.
The maharajah thought surely he must be joking or being modest. He assured him that he was the ruler of the land, rover ch in treasures and can grant any wishes. Still the man insisted.
A bag of rice it is - said the maharajah... or so he thought. When his servants started measuring the grains soon they realized they don’t have enough to fulfill the wish.
In fact, if you do the math you can see yourself that the last square would have required 2 to the power of 64 grains of rice.
That is huge number. If we covered the surface f the Earth with rice it would b still not enough.

Rumour says when the maharajah realized he wouldn’t be able to live up to his promise the inventor revealed his true identity as lord Krishna and told him not to worry, he can pay it over time. That why devote believers still leave some rice on the altar.

With 7 doubling we are past 100, with ten, past a thousand, with twenty past a million.

An easy way to see this for yourself is to see how many times you can fold a piece of paper. Every time you fold it it’s width doubles. The world record is 12

Another way to think about what this means is to consider that every doubling is greater than all previous doubling together.
8 > 1 + 2 + 4
16 > 8 + 4 + 2 + 1
and so on.
Maybe this is why people buy new iPhones, because the new is faster than all previous ones combined.

Exponential growth is very confusing and counter intuitive looking at it from the other direction: backward.
Let’s say there is a lake bed, filling up with water.
If we route a canal into the lake and open the floodgates - or dam - if water is at 10% after a week then is will be at 20% after two weeks and it will take 10 weeks to fill up.
Now imagine there is a bacteria in the lake tinting the water green. For argument’s sake let’s say The bacterial growth is such that it doubles every week... and let’s count backwards.
The week before the lake is full with bacteria it’s only halfway contaminated. And a week prior to that only a quarter. Three weeks before it’s 1/8,
Just six weeks earlier there is only 1% bacteria in the lake. See why this is hard to anticipate?

Slow exponential growth is sublinear

In other words it seems very very slow, the growth curve is practically flatlining for a long time and even “regular” aka liner growth seems desirably better.

The point was s, if growth is really exponential then sooner or later there is always a tipping point and then, when the accelerated returns or compound interest starts to pay off it shoots out.
Of course if you have 100$ in the bank at 1% interest rate it matters if you opened the account or your great grandparents. It makes a huge difference.

When it comes to technologies we call this tipping point going from deceptive to destructive.
Technologies that seems to suddenly skyrocket all went through a long deceptive growth period where progress was so slow it seems as though we would never have anything other than some academic papers maybe.

You get the point. None of this is new. What’s new is that they have tipped over.

So Kurzweil asks if these technologies have been growing and exponentially, we know their growth rate and we know the common characteristics of all exponential curves, the so called hockey sticks... what can we expect?
