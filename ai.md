When I learned programming back in the 90s there was a challenge. If you could write a program that recognizes letter from a scanned page you could make a lot of money.
Optical character recognition (OCR) is today tablestakes.
Both Microsoft and Amazon has recently launched services to go further and recreate a document layout with tables and paragraphs from a scan.

Things that seemed impossible before have been done. It's the past now.
Let's look at some of these:

a computer will never win in chess
well, 1996 Deep Blue won against grandmaster Garry KAsparov

OK, you could brute force your way in chess and just evaluate millions of positions per second with IBM's supercomuter but the same approach won't work for Go, an ancient Chinese game where the combinatorial explosion of possible game states is even greater than chess.

2016, DeepMind Alphago beat 180time world champion LEe Sedol.

ALphaGo learned from a large dataset of historical gameplays.
in 2017 AlphaGo Zero, just starting from the rules of the game and playing with itseff for a couple of days beat ALphaGo 100 to 0.

other fields where AI has beaten humans:
Jeopardy  - with IBM Watson
Texas Hold'em Poker - CMU, 2017
StarCraft
simulated dogfight in a fighterjet - running on a 5$ raspberry pie computer, 2016

humans are still holding out in team play e.g. DOTA ... but with the machines getting really good it's only a matter of time.

something is going on... (to quote a Trump election speech)

These programs exhibit new, unexpected behavior that we can't describe with any adjective other than "creative"... and that's somewhat creepy.
